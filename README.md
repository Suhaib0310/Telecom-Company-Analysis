**Problem: To reduce Churn Rate**

This Telecom's Churn Dataset, consists of cleaned customer activity data, along with a churn label specifying whether the customer cancelled the subscription.
I have explored and analyzed the data to discover key factos responsible for customer churn and came up with ways to ensure customer retention.

**Business Understanding of a Telecom Industry Customer Churn:**

Customer churn is a big problem in any industry and one of the most important concern for the telecom industry.
The effect on the revenues of the companies is huge, because of this customer churn, especially in the telecom field, that's why these companies are seeking to develop a predictive potential customer churn.
In this highly competitive market, the telecommunication industry experiences an average of 15-20% annual churn rate, and it costs 5 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, that's why customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

Therefore, finding those factors that increase customer churn is imporant to take necessary actions to reduce the churn.

**The main goal of my project is to develop an understanding of the cause of customer churn which assists telecom operators to predict customers who are more likely subject to churn, and what to do to retain the most valuable customer.**
